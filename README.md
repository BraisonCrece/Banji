During the development process, I have learned a lot and delve into aspects of Ruby on Rails that I was unaware of.

As well as learning to use design structures and good practices.

The base application is built with the following technologies:
- `Ruby 3.1.2`
- `Rails 7.0.4`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `TailwindCSS`

## During its development I have implemented, learned and perfected :memo::

- Unit and integration **tests with Minitest** :heavy_check_mark:
- **Query Object Pattern** :heavy_check_mark:
- Modularize with **Concerns** :heavy_check_mark:
- List products and favorites with **Turbo Frame** :heavy_check_mark:

- **Instance memoization** ( ||= operator) :heavy_check_mark:
- Avoid **N+1 Query** :heavy_check_mark:
